File names look like this: `myProgram.c`

Execute this command to compile code: `gcc myProgram.c`

Assuming that there are no errors in your code, the compiler would produce an executable program called `a.out`.

Execute this command to run executables: `./a.out`

In this tutorial, you will configure Visual Studio Code to use the GCC C++ compiler (g++) and GDB debugger on Ubuntu in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). GCC stands for GNU Compiler Collection; GDB is the GNU debugger. WSL is a Linux environment within Windows that runs directly on the machine hardware, not in a virtual machine.
