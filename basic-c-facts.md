`include` **directives**. These lines of code are not actually statements which are executed when the program is run, but rather directives to the preprocessor portion of the compiler. In particular, these directives tell the preprocessor to literally include the contents of the named file at that point in the program source, before passing it on to the later steps of the compilation process.
